# Network Analysis

## Third Assignment - Network robustness

In this third and final assignment we will test robustness of networks using different kind of attacks.

First, to check the correctness of our code, we will test robustness on small graphs, then we will test our real network.

<br>

We will use different kind of attacks:

- **random attacks** - nodes will be removed at random
- targeted attacks:
  - **highest degree** - nodes with highest degree will be removed
  - **highest betweenness** - nodes with highest betweenness will be removed
  - **highest closeness** - nodes with highest closeness will be removed
  - **highest pagerank** - nodes with highest pagerank will be removed

> During all the attacks we will consider the largest connected component of the graph.

<br>

Our analysis will be based on the following metrics:

- **size of the largest connected component** - we expect this metric to decrease during the attacks
- **diameter** - we expect this metric to increase (before dipping) during the attacks

### 1. testing on small graphs

In this first part of the assignment we will test the robustness of the network on small graphs. We will use the following graphs:

- Erdos-Renyi graph
- Watts-Strogatz graph

#### 1.1. Erdos-Renyi graph

The Erdos-Renyi graph is a mathematical model for generating random graphs.
The graph is constructed by randomly assigning edges between a fixed number of nodes and it's based on two parameters: the total number of nodes in the graph, denoted as "n" and the probability of any pair of nodes being connected by an edge, denoted as "p".

#### 1.2. Watts-Strogatz graph

The Wattsâ€“Strogatz model is a random graph generation model that produces graphs with small-world properties, including short average path lengths and high clustering.
It's defined by three parameters: `n`, `k` and `p`. `n` is the number of nodes, `k` is the number of nearest neighbors and `p` is the probability of rewiring each edge.
