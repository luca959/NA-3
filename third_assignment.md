# Network Analysis

## Third Assignment - Network robustness

In this third and final assignment we will test robustness of networks using different kind of attacks.

First, to check the correctness of our code, we will test robustness on small graphs, then we will test our real network.

### 1. testing on small graphs

In this first part of the assignment we will test the robustness of the network on small graphs. We will use the following graphs:

- Erdos-Renyi graph
- Watts-Strogatz graph

#### 1.1. Erdos-Renyi graph

#### 1.2. Watts-Strogatz graph
